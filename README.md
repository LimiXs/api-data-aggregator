# API Data Aggregator

A simple Python desktop app for collecting data from external APIs (starting with Clockify) and preparing it for storage in a database.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for non-technical user: choose a data source, click a button, and fetch structured data that can be saved and analyzed later.
